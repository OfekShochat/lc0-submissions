# Leela Chess Zero Submissions
In this repository we maintain the current submissions to important computer chess tournaments like [TCEC](https://tcec-chess.com/) or [CCC](https://www.chess.com/computer-chess-championship).

Older submissions are archived as well, if you want to replicate a specific version of LCZero used in a particular tournament.
